This is an experiment in a futuristic self hosted DOM.

Run the tests with:
     ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start

Note: This library requires ES6 classes, Maps, Sets, iterators, for-of and many
other new features. It's not intended for use in browsers that don't support
that technology.

To use with io.js or node.js:
    node --use-strict --harmony_classes --harmony_arrays
